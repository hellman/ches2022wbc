    "- Briefly, it is an interactive interpreter (called \"kernel\").\n",
    "- However, code is organized in blocks (\"cells\"), which can be ran/edited multiple times.\n",
    "- Select a cell with code and press Shift+Enter to execute it.\n",
    "- As the selection advanced to the next cell, repeated pressing of Shift+Enter executes all cells in order.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Clarification**: there is only one kernel/state (per a notebook) at any point of time.\n",
    "There is no way to \"undo\" a cell execution other than to restart and re-execute the previous cells.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some hotkeys:\n",
    "- (0-0) restart the kernel\n",
    "- **Ctrl+S** save the notebook (including outputs!, but not the kernel state)\n",
    "- (A) add cell above the current one\n",
    "- (B) add cell below the current one\n",
    "- (D-D) remove the current cell\n",
    "- (C) copy the current cell(s)\n",
    "- (V) paste the copied cell(s) below\n",
    "- (Y) set cell type to \"code\"\n",
    "- (R) set cell type to \"raw\"\n",
    "- (M) set cell type to \"markdown\" (supports $\\LaTeX$)\n",
